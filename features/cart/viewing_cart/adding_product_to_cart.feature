    Scenario: Adding a simple product to the cart
        Given the store has a product "T-shirt banana" priced at "â‚¬12.54"
        When I add this product to the cart
        Then I should be on my cart summary page
        And I should be notified that the product has been successfully added
        And I should see one item on my product list
        And this item should have name "T-shirt banana"
